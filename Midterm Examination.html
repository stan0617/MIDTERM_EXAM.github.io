            <h2>Introduction</h2>

<div id= "Stanley Laubinger><a href="https://imgur.com/1vUlLDX"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/1vUlLDX.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" alt= "Stanley Laubinger" style= "float: left" height= "10%" width= "10%"> </a> </div>

            <p>Hi, my name is Stanley Laubinger and you can call me Stan. I'm currently a 3rd year student taking the course of Electrical Engineering.</p> 

<p>I chose this course because I was fascinated by the logic of how electricity works when I first encountered the subject of Circuits in Senior High School. I am glad to be back at the University of Perpetual Help Molino as this is the best university in my current situation. And this is the university where I respect the most number of teachers and professors that I know which is why I know that the education that will be provided is more than enough for me to become a licensed Electrical Engineer.</p>

            <h2>Academic Background</h2>
            <p>I studied here at UPHSD-Molino for my whole High School life and all I can say is a big thank you as I am one of the students who excelled when I was a freshman in college. I studied at FEU Alabang for 3 years, I was a pilot student and the representative of our course, Electrical Engineering, in academic events. And the last thing that I may or may not be proud of, I was the External Vice President of our academic organization. </p>

<p>These experiences that I accumulated from my previous university helped me to become relaxed with all the requirements that are currently given by my subjects. It also shaped my mindset on how I should tackle and organize the things that I am currently doing. I am currently adjusting to my surroundings at UPHSD Molino since I transferred from a different university and stopped for more than a year in 2022.</p>

            <h2>Major Overview</h2>
            <p>Electrical Engineering is the course that I chose to take because out of all the research papers I saw when I was in high school, I was fascinated by what I saw about how electric current works. And the understanding of the past discussions regarding the subject of Circuits seems natural to me. </p>

<p>I am now hoping to contribute an innovation to the whole engineering community in the future. </p>

            <h2>Extracurricular Activities</h2>
            <p>Back when I was still at FEU, we worked on establishing our academic organization to become one of the official student branches of IIEE, the Institute of Integrated Electrical Engineers. We weren't able to do so as COVID-19 hit and all academic activities stopped for a few months. </p>

<p>The first time that I truly enjoyed and witnessed a successful event was here in Molino where we went to Colegio de San Juan de Letran Calamba. I loved the event because not only I was entertained watching the skills contest but it also made my friendship a bit closer with my fellow EE students. I am looking forward to our next event this Monday and Tuesday where I will participate as one of the quizzers for our organization.</p>

            <h2>Skills and Competencies</h2>
            <p>As one of the quizzers of FEU and currently at UPHSD, I am pretty confident with my problem-solving skills. With enough time to practice and train, I might be able to help get one of the awards from chosen competitions. My training in FEU actually helped me to easily understand and remember some of the problems that I already encountered since the professor who trained us is one of the top notchers of his batch. </p>

<p>I also recognize myself as an organized person as I schedule the dates and times of the things to do and strictly follow the set schedule. I am not only focused on studying as of now but I also try to find and save funds because I aim to become a millionaire before I finish my degree. This skill is one that I am mostly proud of since it helps me to be level-headed most of the time. </p>

            <h2>Career Goals</h2>
            <p>My main career goal as an Electrical Engineering student is to at least become a Professional Electrical Engineer with a master's degree and doctorate if possible. I want to focus on Power Systems as this is the specialization that I am truly interested in. And my ultimate goal is to be financially independent through the means of business. </p>
